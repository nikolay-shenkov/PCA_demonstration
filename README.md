This is a Principal Component Analysis demo. We use several datasets from Gapminder (www.gapminder.org) to illustrate how PCA reduces the dimensionality of the original data. Biplots are used to explore the connection between the original features and the principal components. 

The demo is in the PCA demonstration.ipynb notebook. 
utilities.py contains some helpder functions as well as a biplot implementation.
